My fps game which i have been working on for a week or two. I am happy with the code. The movement script is a modification of dani's movement script which includes wall running
Be sure to check out the gun script, the enemy script, the enemyrb script, the turret script, and the slomo script. I shouldv'e use object pooling for the target script i know don't yell at me.
